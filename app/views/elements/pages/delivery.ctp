<p><strong>Stock Indication</strong></p>
<p>Here at Michel Herbelin we use a stock indication system on our web site which informs you if we have the selected item in stock or if it is currently out of stock and due in from our factory. </p>
<p><strong>In Stock</strong></p>
<p>Products displayed as being 'in stock', means we have good stock levels and are available for immediate despatch in our normal delivery timescales. </p>
<p><strong>Out of Stock</strong></p>
<p>Products displayed as being 'Out of Stock' are normally held by us but are temporarily Out of Stock. Stock is due in from the factory but we do not have an estimated date of arrival. </p>
