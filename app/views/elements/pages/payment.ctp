<p><strong>Secure Shopping</strong></p>
<p>Michelherbelin.co.uk is secure, here at Michel Herbelin we take your online security very seriously. We use high-level 128 bit encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions on our website. Rest assured that we take the privacy and security of your personal and payment details very seriously. </p>
<p>This security technology encrypts your personal information including your credit card number, name and address, ensuring that nothing can be read as it travels over the internet. </p>	
<p>You can always check to see whether a page is secure as 'https' will replace 'http' in your browser address window. For example: 'https://secure.michelherbelin.com'. A small padlock will then appear in the bottom bar on the right hand side of your browser window. </p>		
<p><strong>How do you secure my payments?</strong></p>	
<p>We employ state-of-the-art data encryption to ensure safe and secure transactions on our site.</p>	
<p>Our payment area is secured using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer technology (SSL). You'll know when you enter this area because the small yellow padlock appears in the bottom right hand corner of your browser. The other indication is in the address bar. You'll notice that http:// is replaced by https:// (the 's' standing for 'Secure').</p>
<p>Your Internet browser provides visual indications that you are inside a secure site and that all data transferred is securely encrypted.</p>
<p><strong>What is SSL?</strong></p>
<p>Secure Sockets Layer, SSL, is the standard security technology for creating an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between our web server and your browser remains private and secure. This system is used by literally millions of websites worldwide to secure Internet transactions between the server and the customer. </p>
<p>In order to be able to generate an SSL link (signified by the gold padlock in the information tool bar), a web server requires an SSL Certificate. </p>
