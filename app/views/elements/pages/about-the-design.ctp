<p class="headline">Every Michel Herbelin watch starts life on a drawing board at the factory.  The company’s talented team of designers work closely with Jean-Claude Herbelin and together each timepiece is brought to life.</p>
<p>The first stage of the design process is to sketch the watch in pencil.  The sketch is then turned into a more accurate colour drawing.  The drawing is then converted into a CAD diagram and models of the watch are produced in wax and balsa wood before a sample is then made in steel.  During all stages of the process, changes and amendments are made to the design so that the finished result is not only aesthetically pleasing but also tactile and comfortable for the wearer.  Cases have soft edges and are often curved to fit the wrist. Only the softest and most durable leathers are selected for the straps.  A great deal of attention is also given to the dials with many watches utilising materials such as genuine mother of pearl and applied batons.  A selection of dials are also diamond set.</p>
<p>It takes approximately 12 to 18 months for a watch to go from the drawing board to the shop window.  It is only through direct involvement in the design process that Jean-Claude Herbelin can ensure that each creation fits in with the company’s philosophy of creativity combined with attention to detail.  This is also why the Michel Herbelin collection has a strong, cohesive identity.</p>
