<h1>Who We Are</h1>

<p>The Great British Shop is situated in The Old High Street, at the heart of the Creative Quarter in Folkestone, Kent. The business was started by Sue Bedford, an en experienced Retail Buyer from London, in August 2013. Having been a Buyer for many years, Sue had long been aware that the vast majority of product available generally for sale through the UK was sourced from abroad.  The decision was made to see if the growing number of  small and medium size makers left in the UK could be bought together to produce a collection of individual and sometimes unique pieces that would inspire and delight a discerning audience.</p>

<p>All the pieces are, so far as possible, made using UK produced base materials.</p>

<p>We take pleasure in ensuring that as many component parts of the business are sourced within the UK. Our packaging is all made locally, and our own giftwrap is silk screen printed by hand by a local printer using traditional methods. Our ribbon is manufactured in the north of England. We try to recycle where we can.</p>
