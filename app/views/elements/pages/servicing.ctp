<p class="headline">At Michel Herbelin UK we have our own in-house workshop and are able to offer a first class service for all your repair needs.</p>
<p>Whether you require an overhaul for your watch or simply a battery or a new strap, please send your watch to us by Special Delivery post (so that it is insured, tracked and has to be signed for) to the address below.  Please include a covering letter with your name, address and telephone number outlining your requirements and we will contact you with a written estimate within a few days. For your convenience we accept payments by cheque, credit card or through Paypal.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
